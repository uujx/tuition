                The discussion of "Is college worth it?" has become hot in the
                last 10 years. In this project, we show how college tuition fees
                have increased from 2000 to 2016. Then we give a distribution
                chart of how many Americans are repaying for their Federal
                Student Loan. In the end we also show the mid-career salary
                expectation on most college majors.
